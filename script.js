Data Dump Formatting -
  You have been given a raw data dump that is structured as an array of objects. The object's keys are companies, and the values are arrays of emails followed by a 3 digit department number. I need you to write a program that will go through the data, print the emails for each company and what department number that email belongs to. The format could look something like:
  Company One
  email: email@email.com, dept: 123
  email: email@email.com, dept: 123

  Company Two
  email: email@email.com, dept: 123
  email: email@email.com, dept: 123
